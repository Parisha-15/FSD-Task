<!-- You are given a dataset of student test scores.
const students = [
	{ name: 'Alice', scores: { math: 85, science: 90, history: 78 } },
	{ name: 'Bob', scores: { math: 92, science: 88, history: 95 } },
	{ name: 'Charlie', scores: { math: 70, science: 75, history: 80 } },
	{ name: 'Diana', scores: { math: 95, science: 98, history: 93 } }
];
Write code to perform the following tasks:
1. Find the student with the highest average score across all subjects.
2. Return a new object containing only that student's name and their average score, formatted to two decimal places.
You must calculate the average score for each student to find the highest, and your final result should be a single object.
